The History Flashcard Quiz App is designed to make learning history fun, interactive, and efficient. It's built using Kotlin in Android Studio and helps users test their knowledge through a flashcard-style quiz format. Whether you're a student prepping for exams or just brushing up on your trivia, this app keeps things light, engaging, and educational.

What it does:
Presents a set of flashcards with historical questions

Gives immediate feedback after each answer

Shows a final score with a motivational message

Lets users review questions and correct answers afterward
Design Goals & Key Considerations
When designing this app, we focused on three things: keeping it simple, making it visually appealing, and staying true to the historical theme.
User Experience (UX)
Clear navigation from screen to screen
Feedback that motivates users to keep learning
Easy-to-tap buttons for a smooth experience
Visual Design (UI)
Clean layouts that feel focused, not cluttered
Readable text over textured backgrounds
Thematic imagery and color choices that reflect a classic, scholarly vibe
Images & Themes: Bringing History to Life
The images used in the app are handpicked to match the feel of history, learning, and achievement.
Welcome Screen
Image: A vintage world map

Why? Sets the tone — like stepping into a time machine or old library

Design Touch: Faded overlay to make sure the welcome text pops
Flashcard Screen
Image: Aged parchment or old paper texture

Why? Mimics the look of ancient scrolls or historical documents

Design Touch: A light overlay to keep focus on the question and answer buttons
Score & Review Screen
Image: Laurel wreath or certificate-style background
Why? Feels like a reward or achievement at the end of the quiz
Design Touch: Clean layout to showcase the score and review button
To make sure the text is always readable, we used a dark overlay (#80000000) on top of the images.
Colors That Work (and Why We Picked Them)
Element	Color	Hex	Why we chose it
Overlay	Dark Black	#80000000	Helps text stand out on busy images
Main Button	Amber Yellow	#FFC107	Friendly, positive, attention-grabbing
Button Text	Black	#000000	High contrast, easy to read
Headline Text	White	#FFFFFF	Works well on dark backgrounds
Correct Answer	Green	#4CAF50	Instant positive feedback
Incorrect Answer	Red	#F44336	Helps reinforce the correct answer later
Card Background	Cream	#FFF8E1	Looks like old paper, fits the theme
Fonts: Stylish but Functional
Typography plays a big role in creating that historical, academic atmosphere — but we didn’t want it to feel too old-school.
Fonts used:
Headings: sans-serif-medium — clean and readable, with a bit of boldness
Body text: sans-serif — neutral and legible for flashcards and reviews
Optional style for polish: You could add something like Playfair Display or Cormorant Garamond to give it a classic, printed-book feel.
GitHub + GitHub Actions: Version Control Like a Pro
The whole project is managed on GitHub, which makes it easy to track changes, back up progress, and collaborate.
How we used GitHub:
Branching and merging for safe development
Commit history for tracking updates
Issues and Pull Requests to stay organized
CI/CD with GitHub Actions:
Every time we push code to GitHub, GitHub Actions runs a check to make sure the project still builds correctly
Avoids build errors sneaking in
Keeps code quality high
Lets you focus on building cool stuff, not fixing breakages later
